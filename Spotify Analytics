# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Next I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Below are questions and answers regarding the data in the Spotify table.

#1. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT 
artist_name, sum(popularity)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY sum(popularity) desc
LIMIT 10;

#2. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT
track_name as song_name ,avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
Limit 10;

#3. For every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
(SELECT s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)
SELECT
artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
